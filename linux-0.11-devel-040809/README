Now, this is a very basic root file system for linux 0.1x.
I will add more things to this release soon. see the changelog 
bellow.

This release is a basic system. you can test vi, ls,
mkdir etc. Just for testing with kernel source code.
Now I have added gcc 1.40 tools into the harddisk rootimage file.
you can compile some c source file now. enjoy it :-)

NOTE:
By using the resources in this directory, you must first 
install the Bochs emulation software in your system. The
included Bochs-2.1.1.exe is for win32. You can always download
the newest version of it from http://sourceforge.net
 
When testing floppy root (as running bochsrc-fd), when showing
the message of " Insert root floppy and press ENTER", JUST 
press the Enter key. I have already attached the root floppy 
to the 'B:' diskette driver.

The system will panic unpredicatablly. Use at your own risk!

Changelog:
=====================
2004.8.9
	Little Changed. Modified the /usr/src/linux kernel source code.  
	The compiler option '-string-insns' was added by Linus
	to the gcc compiler he used when he learning compiling theory. 
	So we deleted this option in the Makefiles in kernel source.
	Added two files as described below:
	debug.bat         -- The bochs debug batch file.
	SYSTEM.MAP        -- The map file generated by kernel compile. 
	
	Here we just copied it out from hd image file for kernel debugging use.
	Note that if you have modified the kernel source code, you should get
	the new generated one.
	
2004.3.29
	Add gcc 1.40 & libs into the harddisk image. Now you can 
	compile	the orignal kernel sources without need any 
	modification to it! But when running the system,
	please read another README file in /usr/root directory first.
	------------------------------------------------
	cd /usr/root
	gcc -s -o hello hello.c
	./hello
	------------------------------------------------
	files included:
	README		  -- This file.
	Bochs-2.1.1.exe   -- Bochs system for use in win32 environment.
			     Must be installed on your windows system first.
	bootimage-0.11 	  -- kernel 0.11 bootimage request rootimage from floppy.
	bootimage-0.11-fd -- request rootimage in disk b: 
	bootimage-0.11-hd -- boot harddisk root file system.
	bootimage-0.12-fd -- kernel 0.12 bootimage use with floppy root iamge.
	bootimage-0.12-hd -- kernel 0.12 bootimage use with harddisk root image.
	rootimage-0.11    -- kernel 0.11 rootimage.
	hdc-0.11	  -- harddisk root filesystem image.
	diskb.img	  -- a dos format disk image. can be w/r with mtools.
			     example: mdir b:, mcopy b:, mdel b:filename
	bochsrc-fd.bxrc   -- bochs rc file configured for using disk root iamge.
	bochsrc-hd.bxrc   -- bochs rc file configured for using hd root image.
	gcclib-1.40.taz   -- tar files of the gcc bins & libs.
	
	You can change the line 'floppya' in bochsrc-xx.bxrc file to use the 
	diferent bootimage file provided.
	In order to insert any programs into the hd image file, you can use 
	winimage program or something like that to add/delete files in diskb.img
	and then read these files by using mtoos in the system.
				     		     
	Play & enjoy the pleasure of it! 
	
2004.3.4
	This is truelly kernel 0.11 driving system!!
	In order to run bash 1.12.1, I inserted several system
	call stubs. To show  the file date correctly, I added
	one line to the kernel/mktime.c at the top of file.
	For details, see the linux-0.11.dif file.
	
	Add Input/Output tools, such as mtools dealing with DOS
	diskettes, mount/umount command, compress, df, awk...
